# tv-info
A chrome extension that gets information on highlighted television name.

As a frequent visitor to /r/television, I often browse the weekly recommendation
threads. I often have to go back and forth between searching for a recommended
show and reading other recommendations. As a result, I created a chrome
extension, using the TraktTV API, in order to quickly get a description about a
show to see if it is interesting enough to further investigate.
